#### Description:
I've made a web-app called WordNerd where people can play by unscrambling words. Players can choose from 4 ranges of difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Insane. Each step up in difficulty brings more challenge by increasing word length, consequently the score point you get increases in proportion of the level of difficulty.

Trying to unscramble the word without seeing its definition is quite hard, I challenge you if you can? So, introducing hints and answer providing mechanisms, in this case, ‘Bulb’ as I’ve called it, is vital for a good player experience. Therefore, I've made two ways in which players can get support while playing the game. 

These are:
    1. Hint Button: players can see the actual definition of the word being asked.
    2. Bulb: players can click this button to get instant answers one word at a time, but don't worry its only limited to the (wordLength)/2. i.e: the max answers players can get is half of the word’s letters.
   
The website utilizes a single dictionary ‘.csv’ file; from where the algorithm randomly chooses, scrambles and displays it to the webpage. I've also implemented a ranking system where players can progress starting from Barbarian (I know it’s a little harsh word to use but I had to put it in to make it feel like a ‘game’) all the way to becoming a professor. The website has a basic account management system where users can either logout or delete their account. For now, no user can start playing without registering for an account, so be sure to sign up when your met with the login page.

That's all I guess; this was a great journey that I've embarked upon. I've found myself where I've never imagined I'll be thanks to God, again thanks to all the CS50 and Edx crew for making this possible, you guys are awesome! 

My name is Dagmawi and this is CS50!
